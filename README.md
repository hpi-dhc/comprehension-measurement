# Scio â€“ comprehension measurement tool ðŸ’¡

This package simplies measuring the users comprehension of your mobile application. After a quick setup you can ask questions to your users and improve your user experience with the generated insights. The questions are displayed in a survey-like environment and can require multiple choice, single choice or text answers. The questions can be static as well as contextual, where your app provides all necessary information to personalize your survey.

- Contextual Questions
- Opt-out
- Persistent Storage of already answered questions

## Setup

1. Import this package into your Flutter package. See an example on how to achieve this below.
```yaml
scio:
    git: 
      url: https://github.com/hpi-dhc/scio.git
      ref: main
```
2. [Create supabase project](https://app.supabase.com/).
3. Initialize the project tables. You can import [this file](example/database_dump)
into your Supabase project. How to do this is described in [this Supabase discussion](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions/773).
4. Add the following SQL queries under '/sql':
```sql
create function increment_correct_answers(row_id int)
returns void as
$$
  update questions
  set correct_answers = correct_answers + 1
  where id = row_id;
$$
language sql volatile;
```
```sql
create function increment_total_answers(row_id int)
returns void as
$$
  update questions
  set total_answers = total_answers + 1
  where id = row_id;
$$
language sql volatile;
```
These are needed to track the number of correct and total answers to your questions.

5. Add the surveys, questions and answers that you need
6. Use Scio to measure user comprehension in your project

## Usage

There are multiple ways to integrate comprehension measurement using this package.

1. [Use `measureComprehension`-function](#use-measurecomprehension-function)
2. [Use `ComprehensionHelper`-class](#use-comprehensionhelper-class)
3. [Use `AutoComprehensiblePage`](#use-autocomprehensiblepage)

### Use `measureComprehension`-function

To have complete control over when the survey component is opened, it can be
called with the measureComprehension method. When calling this method the
hive boxes are initialized first and then filled with the previously saved data. If the
user opted out of surveys or the specified survey is already completed the method
returns without a widget.

This method can be called from any page and displays the survey correctly, so
it enables the developer to define a custom logic on when to call the survey, e.g
the survey should only be shown when specific conditions are met. This method
takes all parameters needed to create the comprehension model and comprehension
widget.

### Use `ComprehensionHelper`-class

When pushing a new page we can attach the helper method `ComprehensionHelper.instance.attach` to it. This is done by passing a method call like `context.router.push(Route())` to the singleton. After the page is popped from the router stack, which means that the user has left the page, the survey is called. For example, this class can be used when the tab is changed, since this does not pop the target page from the router stack, but still leaves the page.

### Use `AutoComprehensiblePage`

Developers looking for fast results without extra effort into survey control should use the `AutoComprehensiblePage`. This page extends `StatefulWidget` and provides the functionality to open a comprehension measurement widget based on chance when the `AutoComprehensiblePage` is left.

For this to work, you have to add the class `AutoRouteObserver` to your [`AutoRoute`-configuration](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route#navigation-observers).

## Contextual Questions

This package enables you to personalize questions based on the context of your application. Just pass a `questionContext` to the package, with key value pairs you are referencing in the database with `is_contextual` set to true and the `context` set to the key.

## Testing

The total line coverage is 65.1%. 

The `ComprehensionMeasurementModel` and `ComprehensionMeasurementWidget` and the other widgets located in the `types` folder are fully tested. However the `ComprehensionHelper` and `AutoComprehensiblePage` are not tested. Moreover, we do not test the Hive box  `SurveyData` and we do not cover generated files, because all are external dependencies.
